### --------------- For app.py ---------------- ###

1. display "title"
    - streamlit --> title
2. Add text box below title for user
    - streamlit --> selectbox
3. On the above box, we want to show movies list
    - using pickle, we dump our movies name project file "movie_list.pkl"
4. Add button "recommend"
    - streamlit --> button
    - fetch multiple movie names => dump file "similarity.pkl"
5. Append movies in recommend list
6. Final, we need posters of the movies
    - We use movies_id to fetch movie posters
    - fetch posters from API
    - tmdb -> API Key (copy1) => tmdb API -> movies -> get details API (copy2) => google -> paste2
        -- In this link, <api key> -> paste1 => Enter -> copy3
    - Google -> JSON viewer -> text - paste3 => Veiwer -> poster_path - copy4
7. Display posters
    - streamlit -> layout your app


### ---- For Deployment ---- ###

- Make "procfile"
    => To run the streamlit app on "heroku", we have to use this code
- Make "setup.sh"
    => Contains OS related commands --> making directories for setup
- Make "gitignore"
    => venv
- A list of all libraries which are required for this project to run on the server (heroku libraries)
    => Our project code editor terminal -> pip freeze > requirements.txt


### Important terminal commands:-

- To run your program --> streamlit run <your_file_name>
- Installing every library at once --> python -m requirements.txt
